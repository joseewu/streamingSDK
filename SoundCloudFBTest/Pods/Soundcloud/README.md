SoundcloudSDK is a framework written in Swift over Soundcloud API.

## Installation

* Cocoapods: `pod 'Soundcloud'`
* Carthage: `github "delannoyk/SoundcloudSDK"`

## Usage

### Configuration

First step to use the SDK is to configure it to use your application credentials:

```swift
Soundcloud.clientIdentifier = "YOUR_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER"
Soundcloud.clientSecret  = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
Soundcloud.redirectURI = "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
```
After that, you're good to go.

### Track

* Load track by identifier

    ```swift
    Tracks.track(identifier: Int, completion: SimpleAPIResponse<Track> -> Void)
    ```
* Load tracks by identifiers

    ```swift
    Tracks.tracks(identifiers: [Int], completion: SimpleAPIResponse<[Track]> -> Void)
    ```
* Get list of comments

    ```swift
    let track: Track
    track.comments(completion: PaginatedAPIResponse<Comment> -> Void)
    ```
* Get list of favoriters

    ```swift
    let track: Track
    track.favoriters(completion: PaginatedAPIResponse<User> -> Void)
    ```
    
* Search tracks

    ```swift
    let queries: [SearchQueryOptions] = [
        .QueryString("The text to search"),
        .Tags(["list", "of", "tags", "to", "search", "for"]),
        .Genres(["punk", "rock", "..."]),
        .Types([TrackType.Live, TrackType.Demo])
    ]
    Track.search(queries, completion: PaginatedAPIResponse<Track> -> Void)
    ```
    
* Relative tracks
    ```swift
    Track.relatedTracks(identifier: Int, completion: SimpleAPIResponse<[Track]> -> Void)
    ```

### User

* Load user by identifier

    ```swift
    User.user(identifier: Int, completion: SimpleAPIResponse<User> -> Void)
    ```
* Load list of user's tracks

    ```swift
    let user: User
    user.tracks(completion: PaginatedAPIResponse<Track> -> Void)
    ```
* Load list of user's comments

    ```swift
    let user: User
    user.comments(completion: PaginatedAPIResponse<Comment> -> Void)
    ```
* Load list of user's favorite tracks

    ```swift
    let user: User
    user.favorites(completion: PaginatedAPIResponse<Track> -> Void)
    ```
* Load list of user's followers

    ```swift
    let user: User
    user.followers(completion: PaginatedAPIResponse<User> -> Void)
    ```
* Load list of user's followings

    ```swift
    let user: User
    user.followings(completion: PaginatedAPIResponse<User> -> Void)
    ```

### Resolve

```swift
Soundcloud.resolve(URI: String, completion: SimpleAPIResponse<ResolveResponse> -> Void)
```
where `ResolveResponse`is a typealias for `ResolveResponse = (users: [User]?, tracks: [Track]?, playlist: Playlist?)`

### Login

The login method implements the standard OAuth2 of Soundcloud. Some private methods requires the user to be logged in. These are listed below.

#### Session

* Login

    ```swift
    Session.login(displayViewController: UIViewController, completion: SimpleAPIResponse<Session> -> Void)
    ```
* Refresh token

    ```swift
    let session = Soundcloud.session
    session?.refreshSession(completion: SimpleAPIResponse<Session> -> Void)
    ```
* Logout

    ```swift
    let session = Soundcloud.session
    session?.destroy()
    ```

#### Methods that require a Session
* User's profile

    ```swift
    let session = Soundcloud.session
    session?.me(completion: SimpleAPIResponse<User> -> Void)
    ```
* Comment a track

    ```swift
    let track: Track
    track.comment(body: String, timestamp: NSTimeInterval, completion: SimpleAPIResponse<Comment> -> Void)
    ```
* Favorite a track

    ```swift
    let track: Track
    track.favorite(userIdentifier: Int, completion: SimpleAPIResponse<Bool> -> Void)
    ```
* Unfavorite a track

    ```swift
    let track: Track
    track.unfavorite(userIdentifier: Int, completion: SimpleAPIResponse<Bool> -> Void)
    ```
* Follow a user

    ```swift
    let user: User
    user.follow(userIdentifier: Int, completion: SimpleAPIResponse<Bool> -> Void)
    ```
* Unfollow a user

    ```swift
    let user: User
    user.unfollow(userIdentifier: Int, completion: SimpleAPIResponse<Bool> -> Void)
    ```

## Next steps

* Add unit tests
* Analyse if it's necessary to ease up things to play a file (Integrate an audio player/a dependency ?)
